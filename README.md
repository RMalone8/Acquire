# Acquire
The first game I ever made from scratch! This project is how I taught myself Python, and so it is about as spaghetti code as it gets. Still, something I'm very proud of. Unfortunately I did not make the screen size dynamic at all and it is fitted to the Surface laptop that I had freshman year, so it doesn't fit the size of a typical PC very well, but should still be playable!
